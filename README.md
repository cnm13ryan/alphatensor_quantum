# AlphaTensor-Quantum

This repository accompanies the paper

> Ruiz, F. J. R. et al. Quantum Circuit Optimization with AlphaTensor.
*Nature Machine Intelligence* (2024).

There are two directories:

- `/src` contains the code developed for this project pertaining to the
reinforcement learning algorithm, along with a subdirectory `/src/demo`
containing a runnable demo that connects this code with a simplified version of
[AlphaTensor](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05172-4), built using
the [MCTX](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mctx) package.

- `/decompositions` contains the outputs of AlphaTensor-Quantum reported in the
paper in the form of tensor decompositions, along with a Colab showing how to
load and inspect them. Decompositions are stored in `.npz` files containing a
Python dictionary mapping from the circuit name (a string) to a boolean Numpy
array of shape `(num_decompositions, num_factors, tensor_size)`, where we report
*at most* `num_decompositions = 10` non-equivalent decompositions (equivalence
is determined solely based on factor permutations).

Note that this repository does *not* contain the code to convert quantum
circuits into binary tensors; this is provided in a separate repository,
[Circuit-to-Tensor](https://github.com/tlaakkonen/circuit-to-tensor).

## Installation

- `/src`: No installation required. This folder does not contain runnable code.

- `/src/demo`: A machine with Python 3 installed is required, ideally with a
hardware accelerator such as a GPU or TPU. The required dependencies (assuming
an Nvidia GPU is available) can be installed by executing
`pip3 install -r alphatensor_quantum/src/demo/requirements.txt` (this has been
tested with Python 3.11.9 on an Nvidia Quadro P1000 GPU).

- `/decompositions`: No installation required. The provided notebook can be
opened and run in Google Colab.


## Usage

- `/src`: This folder does not contain runnable code.

- `/src/demo`: Execute `python3 -m alphatensor_quantum.src.demo.run_demo` on
the command line, from the parent directory that contains the
`alphatensor_quantum` repository as a subdirectory.

- `/decompositions`: The notebook `load_decompositions.ipynb` can be opened via
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/alphatensor_quantum/blob/master/decompositions/load_decompositions.ipynb).
When running the notebook, you will be asked to upload certain files containing
the decompositions; please select the appropriate `.npz` file from the folder.
