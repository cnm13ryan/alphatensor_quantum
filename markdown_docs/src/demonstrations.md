## FunctionDef _resample_factors(state, prob_zero_factor_entry, overwrite_only_zero_factors)
### Function Overview
**_resample_factors** is a function designed to sample and overwrite factors within a loop state based on specified probabilities and conditions. This function is used as part of Jax while loops to generate random factors with specific properties.

### Parameters
- **state**: The current state of the loop, represented by an instance of `_LoopState`.
  - **referencer_content**: True (Referenced in `_generate_random_factors`, `_generate_three_linearly_independent_factors`, and `_generate_two_linearly_independent_factors`)
  - **reference_letter**: False (No internal calls to other functions)
- **prob_zero_factor_entry**: A probability value indicating the likelihood of a factor being zero.
  - **referencer_content**: True (Referenced in `_generate_random_factors`, `_generate_three_linearly_independent_factors`, and `_generate_two_linearly_independent_factors`)
  - **reference_letter**: False (No internal calls to other functions)
- **overwrite_only_zero_factors**: A boolean flag indicating whether only factors that are currently zero should be overwritten.
  - **referencer_content**: True (Referenced in `_generate_random_factors`, `_generate_three_linearly_independent_factors`, and `_generate_two_linearly_independent_factors`)
  - **reference_letter**: False (No internal calls to other functions)

### Return Values
- The function returns a new instance of `_LoopState` with updated factors.

### Detailed Explanation
The function begins by splitting the current state into `rng` (random number generator) and `factors`. It then generates a Bernoulli distribution based on the provided probability (`prob_zero_factor_entry`) to determine which factors should be zero. If `overwrite_only_zero_factors` is set to True, only those factors that are currently zero will be considered for overwriting; otherwise, all factors may be overwritten.

The function uses Jax's random number generation capabilities to ensure reproducibility and efficiency in generating the Bernoulli distribution. The resulting binary mask (`mask`) indicates which factors should remain unchanged (0) or be overwritten with new values (1).

Finally, the function updates the `factors` array based on the `mask`, ensuring that only the specified factors are modified. It returns a new `_LoopState` object containing the updated random number generator and the modified factors.

### Relationship Description
**_resample_factors** is primarily used by higher-level functions to generate factors with specific properties:
- **Callers**: The function is referenced in `_generate_random_factors`, `_generate_three_linearly_independent_factors`, and `_generate_two_linearly_independent_factors`. These functions utilize `_resample_factors` within Jax while loops to iteratively refine the factor matrices until they meet certain criteria (e.g., linear independence or non-zero entries).

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions
- **Limitations**: The function assumes that `state.factors` is a 2D array where each row represents a separate factor. It does not handle cases where `factors` might be of different shapes.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `prob_zero_factor_entry` is set to 1, all factors will be zero after the first iteration.
  - If `overwrite_only_zero_factors` is False and `prob_zero_factor_entry` is very low, it may take many iterations for the loop to terminate if the condition for termination (e.g., linear independence) requires non-zero entries.
- **Refactoring Suggestions**:
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: For clarity, consider introducing variables that explain complex expressions within the function, such as the `mask` generation step.
  - **Extract Method**: If additional logic is added to handle different types of factor matrices or more complex conditions, consider extracting these into separate methods for better modularity and readability.
  - **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: Ensure that conditional statements are clear and concise. Use guard clauses where applicable to reduce nesting and improve readability.

By adhering to these guidelines, the function can be maintained and extended with minimal disruption to its core functionality.
## FunctionDef _generate_random_factors(num_factors, size, prob_zero_factor_entry, rng)
Certainly. To proceed with the documentation, I will need a description or specification of the "target object" you are referring to. This could be a piece of software, a hardware component, a system architecture, or any other technical entity that requires detailed documentation. Please provide the necessary details so that the documentation can be crafted accurately and comprehensively according to the guidelines provided.

### FunctionDef _cond_fun(state)
### Function Overview
**_cond_fun** returns a boolean value indicating whether the input factors are linearly dependent or all-zero.

### Parameters
- **state**: An instance of `_LoopState` containing the current factors and a Jax random key. 
  - **referencer_content**: This function is called by `_generate_three_linearly_independent_factors`.
  - **reference_letter**: This function calls `factors_lib.factors_are_linearly_independent`.

### Return Values
- A boolean value (`jt.Bool[jt.Scalar, '']`) indicating whether the factors are either linearly dependent or all-zero.

### Detailed Explanation
**_cond_fun** performs two checks on the factors contained within the provided `_LoopState` object:
1. It first determines if any of the factors are entirely zero using `jnp.any(jnp.all(state.factors == 0, axis=-1))`. This expression evaluates to `True` if there is at least one factor that consists only of zeros.
2. Next, it checks for linear dependence among the factors by calling `factors_lib.factors_are_linearly_independent(*state.factors)`, and then negating the result with `jnp.logical_not()`. If the factors are not linearly independent, this part evaluates to `True`.

The function returns `True` if either of these conditions is met: any factor is all-zero or the factors are linearly dependent. This boolean value can be used in control flow structures such as loops to determine whether further processing is needed.

### Relationship Description
- **Callers**: `_cond_fun` is called by `_generate_three_linearly_independent_factors`. This indicates that `_cond_fun` serves a conditional role within the loop or iterative process managed by `_generate_three_linearly_independent_factors`.
- **Callees**: `_cond_fun` calls `factors_lib.factors_are_linearly_independent`, which suggests that it relies on this external function to determine linear independence among factors.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions
- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: The current implementation uses a combination of logical operations (`jnp.logical_or`) to combine the two conditions. This can be made more readable by using guard clauses or introducing explaining variables.
  - Example:
    ```python
    def _cond_fun(state: _LoopState) -> jt.Bool[jt.Scalar, '']:
        any_factor_is_zero = jnp.any(jnp.all(state.factors == 0, axis=-1))
        if any_factor_is_zero:
            return True
        
        factors_are_dependent = not factors_lib.factors_are_linearly_independent(*state.factors)
        return factors_are_dependent
    ```
- **Extract Method**: If the logic for checking linear dependence or zero factors becomes more complex, consider extracting these checks into separate functions to improve modularity.
  - Example:
    ```python
    def _any_factor_is_zero(factors):
        return jnp.any(jnp.all(factors == 0, axis=-1))
    
    def _factors_are_dependent(factors):
        return not factors_lib.factors_are_linearly_independent(*factors)
    
    def _cond_fun(state: _LoopState) -> jt.Bool[jt.Scalar, '']:
        if _any_factor_is_zero(state.factors):
            return True
        return _factors_are_dependent(state.factors)
    ```
- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: For clarity, especially in more complex expressions, introducing explaining variables can help convey the purpose of each part of the logic.
  - Example:
    ```python
    def _cond_fun(state: _LoopState) -> jt.Bool[jt.Scalar, '']:
        any_factor_is_zero = jnp.any(jnp.all(state.factors == 0, axis=-1))
        factors_are_dependent = not factors_lib.factors_are_linearly_independent(*state.factors)
        
        return any_factor_is_zero or factors_are_dependent
    ```

These refactoring suggestions aim to enhance the readability and maintainability of the code while preserving its functionality.

### FunctionDef _cond_fun(state)
### Function Overview
**_cond_fun**: Returns whether the input factors are linearly dependent or all-zero.

### Parameters
- **state**: An instance of `_LoopState` representing the current state of the loop. This parameter encapsulates the factors and a random key used in some auxiliary functions.
  - **referencer_content**: Not explicitly provided, but inferred from context as this function is part of a larger process involving loops and factor generation.
  - **reference_letter**: Not explicitly provided, but it can be inferred that this function is likely called within a loop or iterative process to check the condition for continuing or terminating.

### Return Values
- A boolean value (`jt.Bool[jt.Scalar, '']`) indicating whether the factors are either all-zero or linearly dependent. In the context of GF(2), two non-zero factors are considered linearly dependent if they are equal.

### Detailed Explanation
The function `_cond_fun` checks for two conditions related to the `factors` attribute in the provided `state` object:
1. **Any Factor is Zero**: It first determines if any factor vector within `state.factors` is entirely zero using `jnp.any(jnp.all(state.factors == 0, axis=-1))`. This checks each factor vector across all dimensions to see if every element in the vector is zero.
2. **Factors Are Dependent**: In GF(2), two non-zero factors are considered linearly dependent if they are identical. The function checks this condition using `jnp.all(state.factors[0] == state.factors[1])`, which compares the first and second factor vectors element-wise to determine if they are equal.

The final return value is a logical OR of these two conditions, meaning `_cond_fun` returns `True` if either any factor vector is all-zero or the factors are linearly dependent (equal in GF(2)).

### Relationship Description
- **referencer_content**: This function is likely part of an iterative process where it serves as a condition to terminate or continue based on the state's factors. It is called within a loop that manipulates `_LoopState` objects.
- **reference_letter**: The function itself does not call any other functions but is presumably called by higher-level logic managing loops and factor generation.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions
- **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases where `state.factors` might have fewer than two factors, which would cause an error in the current implementation. Adding a check for the number of factors before performing comparisons could prevent such issues.
- **Refactoring Suggestions**:
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: To improve readability, introduce explaining variables for complex expressions like `any_factor_is_zero` and `factors_are_dependent`.
    ```python
    all_factors_zero = jnp.any(jnp.all(state.factors == 0, axis=-1))
    factors_equal = jnp.all(state.factors[0] == state.factors[1])
    return jnp.logical_or(all_factors_zero, factors_equal)
    ```
  - **Guard Clauses**: Use guard clauses to handle edge cases early in the function. For example, check if there are fewer than two factors and handle this case explicitly.
    ```python
    if state.factors.shape[0] < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two factors are required.")
    ```
- **Encapsulation**: Ensure that `_LoopState` is properly encapsulated to prevent direct manipulation of its attributes, promoting better maintainability.

By addressing these points, the function can be made more robust and easier to understand.

## ClassDef _NumGadgetsLoopState
**Function Overview**:  
_`_NumGadgetsLoopState`_: The loop state used in functions for sampling the number of gadgets during a probabilistic sampling process.

**Parameters**:
- **next_num_gadgets**: 
  - Indicates the number of gadgets to sample in the current iteration.
  - **referencer_content**: True (Referenced by `_body_fun`)
  - **reference_letter**: False
- **num_toffoli_gadgets**: 
  - Represents the count of Toffoli gadgets sampled so far.
  - **referencer_content**: True (Referenced by `_cond_fun` and `_body_fun`)
  - **reference_letter**: False
- **num_cs_gadgets**: 
  - Represents the count of CS gadgets sampled so far.
  - **referencer_content**: True (Referenced by `_cond_fun` and `_body_fun`)
  - **reference_letter**: False
- **rng**: 
  - Random number generator state used for sampling operations.
  - **referencer_content**: True (Referenced by `_body_fun`)
  - **reference_letter**: False

**Return Values**:
- _NumGadgetsLoopState_: This class does not return a value directly. Instead, it is used to maintain the state across iterations of a loop.

**Detailed Explanation**:
The `_NumGadgetsLoopState` class encapsulates the state required for sampling gadgets in a probabilistic manner. It holds the number of gadgets left to sample (`next_num_gadgets`), and the counts of two types of gadgets already sampled (`num_toffoli_gadgets`, `num_cs_gadgets`). The random number generator state (`rng`) is used within the loop to ensure randomness in sampling.

The class serves as a container for these values, which are modified iteratively by functions like `_body_fun` and checked by conditions like `_cond_fun`. This encapsulation allows for clear tracking of the state throughout the sampling process.

**Relationship Description**:
- **Referencer Content**: The parameters `next_num_gadgets`, `num_toffoli_gadgets`, `num_cs_gadgets`, and `rng` are referenced within `_body_fun` and `_cond_fun`. These functions modify or check these values to control the sampling process.
- There is no reference_letter indicating that this class does not directly call any other components.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Encapsulate Collection**: If additional gadget types are introduced, consider encapsulating the counts of different gadgets into a single collection (e.g., dictionary or custom object) to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.
- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: In `_cond_fun`, the expression `num_factors_taken = state.num_toffoli_gadgets * 7 + state.num_cs_gadgets * 3` could be replaced with an explaining variable for clarity, such as `total_factors_taken`.
- **Extract Method**: The logic within `_body_fun` and `_cond_fun` is well-contained but can be further modularized if additional sampling rules or conditions are introduced. For example, the random sampling logic in `_body_fun` could be extracted into a separate method.
- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: If more complex stopping criteria are added to `_cond_fun`, consider using guard clauses to improve readability and maintainability.

By adhering to these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more modular, easier to understand, and adaptable to future changes.
## FunctionDef _sample_num_gadgets_per_type(num_gadgets, num_factors, prob_toffoli_gadget, rng)
Certainly. To proceed with the documentation, it is necessary to have a description or a detailed view of the "target object" you are referring to. This could be a piece of software, a hardware component, a system architecture, or any other technical entity that requires formal documentation. Please provide the relevant details or specifications so that the documentation can be crafted accurately and comprehensively.

If you have specific code or technical descriptions available, please share them as well, so they can be directly referenced in the documentation to ensure precision and accuracy.
### FunctionDef _body_fun(state)
**Function Overview**:  
_`_body_fun`_: This function samples the number of gadgets of each type (Toffoli and CS) given a loop state and updates the state accordingly.

**Parameters**:
- **state**: 
  - The current state of the sampling process, encapsulated in an instance of `_NumGadgetsLoopState`.
  - **referencer_content**: True (Referenced by the loop that calls this function)
  - **reference_letter**: False

**Return Values**:
- **_NumGadgetsLoopState**: A new instance of `_NumGadgetsLoopState` with updated values for `next_num_gadgets`, `num_toffoli_gadgets`, `num_cs_gadgets`, and `rng`.

**Detailed Explanation**:  
The function `_body_fun` performs the following steps:
1. It uses the random number generator key (`rng`) from the input state to sample the number of Toffoli gadgets.
2. The total number of gadgets to consider in the next iteration (`next_num_gadgets`) is decremented by one, reflecting that a gadget has been sampled.
3. The number of CS gadgets is updated by subtracting the newly sampled number of Toffoli gadgets from `next_num_gadgets`.
4. A new random number generator key is generated to ensure randomness in subsequent iterations.
5. The function returns a new `_NumGadgetsLoopState` object with these updated values.

**Relationship Description**:  
The function `_body_fun` is referenced by the loop that manages the sampling process, acting as a callee within this context. It does not call any other components directly, so there are no callees to describe.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Extract Method**: The random sampling logic could be extracted into a separate method if additional types of gadgets or more complex sampling rules are introduced in the future.
- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: For clarity, consider introducing an explaining variable for the number of Toffoli gadgets sampled to make the code easier to read and understand.
- **Encapsulate Collection**: If the state object (`_NumGadgetsLoopState`) is modified extensively or used in multiple places, consider encapsulating its creation and updates within a class to improve modularity and maintainability.

By adhering to these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more modular, easier to understand, and adaptable to future changes.
***
### FunctionDef _cond_fun(state)
**Function Overview**:  
_`_cond_fun`_: This function determines whether a loop should continue based on the total number of factors taken by Toffoli and CS gadgets.

**Parameters**:
- **state**: 
  - Type: `_NumGadgetsLoopState`
  - Description: The current state of the gadget sampling process, containing counts of Toffoli and CS gadgets.
  - **referencer_content**: True (Referenced by the loop controlling function)
  - **reference_letter**: False

**Return Values**:
- **Type**: `jt.Bool[jt.Scalar, '']`
- **Description**: A boolean value indicating whether the loop should continue. The loop continues if the total number of factors taken exceeds a specified threshold (`num_factors`).

**Detailed Explanation**:  
The `_cond_fun` function evaluates whether the cumulative number of factors attributed to Toffoli and CS gadgets surpasses a predefined limit, `num_factors`. It calculates this by multiplying the count of Toffoli gadgets by 7 (assuming each Toffoli gadget contributes 7 factors) and the count of CS gadgets by 3 (assuming each CS gadget contributes 3 factors). The sum of these products represents the total number of factors taken. If this value exceeds `num_factors`, the function returns `True`, indicating that the loop should continue; otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Relationship Description**:  
- **Referencer Content**: `_cond_fun` is referenced by a controlling function within the project that manages the looping mechanism based on the returned boolean value.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: To improve readability, consider introducing an explaining variable for the total number of factors calculation. This would make the code more understandable by giving a clear name to the computed value.
  - Example: `total_factors = (state.num_toffoli_gadgets * 7) + (state.num_cs_gadgets * 3)`
- **Extract Method**: If this function becomes part of a larger, more complex condition or if similar calculations are needed elsewhere, consider extracting it into a separate method. This would enhance modularity and reusability.
- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: Although the current conditional expression is straightforward, ensuring that any future additions to this logic remain clear and concise is important. Guard clauses can be used if additional conditions are introduced to maintain readability.

By adhering to these refactoring suggestions, the code will become more maintainable and easier to understand for future developers or modifications.

### FunctionDef _cond_fun(state)
# Technical Documentation: `_cond_fun` Function

## Function Overview
The `_cond_fun` function determines whether there are still gadgets (Toffoli or CS) to be added based on the current state.

## Parameters
- **state**: An instance of `_GadgetLoopState`. This parameter represents the current loop state used in functions for overwriting factors with gadgets.
  - **referencer_content**: True, as this function is called within the `_overwrite_factors_with_gadgets` function.
  - **reference_letter**: False, as there are no further calls made from within `_cond_fun`.

## Return Values
- Returns a boolean value indicating whether there are remaining Toffoli or CS gadgets to be added.

## Detailed Explanation
The `_cond_fun` function checks if there are any remaining Toffoli or CS gadgets that need to be added by examining the `num_toffoli_gadgets` and `num_cs_gadgets` attributes of the provided `state`. The logic is straightforward:
- It returns `True` if either `num_toffoli_gadgets` or `num_cs_gadgets` is greater than zero, indicating that there are still gadgets to be added.
- Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function uses a simple logical OR operation to determine the return value:
```python
return state.num_toffoli_gadgets > 0 or state.num_cs_gadgets > 0
```

## Relationship Description
- **referencer_content**: The `_cond_fun` function is called by the `_overwrite_factors_with_gadgets` function. This relationship indicates that `_cond_fun` serves as a condition-checking utility within the loop logic of `_overwrite_factors_with_gadgets`.
- **reference_letter**: There are no further calls made from within `_cond_fun`, so there are no callees to describe.

## Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions
### Limitations and Edge Cases
- The function assumes that `state` is a valid instance of `_GadgetLoopState`. If this assumption is violated, the behavior of the function may be undefined.
- The function does not perform any validation on the attributes of `state`, so it relies on the correctness of the data passed to it.

### Refactoring Suggestions
- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: Although the current implementation is simple and clear, introducing an explaining variable could enhance readability, especially if the logic were to become more complex in the future.
  ```python
  has_remaining_toffoli = state.num_toffoli_gadgets > 0
  has_remaining_cs = state.num_cs_gadgets > 0
  return has_remaining_toffoli or has_remaining_cs
  ```
- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: The current conditional expression is already quite simple, but if additional conditions were to be added in the future, using guard clauses could improve readability.
- **Encapsulate Collection**: While not directly applicable here, encapsulating the state management logic within `_GadgetLoopState` or similar structures can help maintain separation of concerns and enhance modularity.

By adhering to these guidelines, the function remains clear and maintainable, with room for future enhancements if necessary.

## FunctionDef get_action_and_value(demonstration, move_index)
### Function Overview
**`get_action_and_value`**: Returns the next action and the value of a demonstration at a given index.

### Parameters
- **demonstration**: A synthetic demonstration. This parameter is an instance of the `Demonstration` class, which includes attributes such as `tensor`, `num_factors`, `factors`, `factors_complete_toffoli_gadget`, and `factors_complete_cs_gadget`.
  - **referencer_content**: True (This function is likely called by other parts of the project that require action and value information from demonstrations.)
  - **reference_letter**: False (No specific callees are mentioned in the provided context.)
- **move_index**: The index of the move to consider, an integer in {0, ..., demonstration.num_factors - 1}. This method does not check whether `move_index` is within valid range.
  - **referencer_content**: True (This parameter is used by other components that need to specify which move to analyze.)
  - **reference_letter**: False (No specific callees are mentioned in the provided context.)

### Return Values
- A 2-tuple containing:
  - The factor at `move_index` as an action index, i.e., as a scalar in {0, ..., num_actions - 1}, where `num_actions = 2 ** tensor_size - 1`.
  - The value at the given move index, i.e., the sum of all future rewards.

### Detailed Explanation
The function `get_action_and_value` is designed to extract specific information from a synthetic demonstration object. It performs the following steps:

1. **Extract Action**: 
   - Utilizes `jnp.take` to retrieve the factor at the specified `move_index`.
   - Converts this factor into an action index using `factors_lib.action_factor_to_index`.

2. **Calculate Value**:
   - Defines a helper function `_body_fun` that adjusts the value based on whether the current factor is part of a Toffoli or CS gadget.
   - Uses `jax.lax.fori_loop` to iterate from `move_index` to `demonstration.num_factors`, applying `_body_fun` to accumulate the total value. The initial value (`init_val`) is calculated as `(move_index - demonstration.num_factors).astype(jnp.float_)`.

### Relationship Description
- **referencer_content**: This function is likely called by other parts of the project that require action and value information from demonstrations.
- **reference_letter**: No specific callees are mentioned in the provided context.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function does not check if `move_index` is within the valid range (0 to `demonstration.num_factors - 1`). This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
  - Consider adding validation for `move_index` to ensure it falls within the acceptable range.

- **Refactoring Suggestions**:
  - **Extract Method**: The logic inside `_body_fun` can be extracted into a separate function for better readability and reusability.
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: Use explaining variables for complex expressions, such as `(move_index - demonstration.num_factors).astype(jnp.float_)`, to improve clarity.
  - **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: If `_body_fun` contains multiple conditionals based on types or values, consider simplifying them using guard clauses.

By implementing these suggestions, the function can become more robust and maintainable.
### FunctionDef _body_fun(i, v)
**Function Overview**: The `_body_fun` function calculates a modified value based on specific conditions related to factors completing Toffoli and CS gadgets.

**Parameters**:
- **i (int)**: An integer index used to access elements from `demonstration.factors_complete_toffoli_gadget` and `demonstration.factors_complete_cs_gadget`.
- **v (jt.Float[jt.Scalar, ''])**: A scalar value that is modified based on the conditions checked within the function.

**Return Values**:
- The function returns a modified version of the input value `v`, adjusted by adding either `factors_lib.TOFFOLI_REWARD_SAVING` or `factors_lib.CS_REWARD_SAVING` if specific conditions are met, otherwise it adds 0.0.

**Detailed Explanation**:
The `_body_fun` function takes two parameters: an integer index `i` and a scalar value `v`. It checks whether the element at index `i` in `demonstration.factors_complete_toffoli_gadget` is true. If so, it adds `factors_lib.TOFFOLI_REWARD_SAVING` to `v`. If not, it proceeds to check if the element at index `i` in `demonstration.factors_complete_cs_gadget` is true. If this condition holds, it adds `factors_lib.CS_REWARD_SAVING` to `v`. In all other cases, no additional value is added to `v`.

**Relationship Description**:
- **referencer_content**: Not explicitly provided in the documentation request, but based on the hierarchical structure, `_body_fun` appears to be part of a larger function or method (`get_action_and_value`) and likely called within that context.
- **reference_letter**: Not explicitly provided, but given its role in modifying values conditionally, it is likely used by other parts of the project where such calculations are necessary.

Since `referencer_content` and `reference_letter` are not truthy based on the provided information, there is no detailed functional relationship to describe beyond what is directly inferred from the code structure.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Complex Conditional Logic**: The nested conditional logic can be simplified for better readability. A potential refactoring technique would be **Simplify Conditional Expressions** by using guard clauses or breaking down the conditions into separate functions.
- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: Introducing variables to represent the conditions could improve clarity, especially if these checks are used elsewhere in the codebase. This aligns with the **Introduce Explaining Variable** refactoring technique.
- **Encapsulate Collection Access**: If `demonstration.factors_complete_toffoli_gadget` and `demonstration.factors_complete_cs_gadget` are frequently accessed or modified, consider encapsulating them within a class to improve modularity. This would align with the **Encapsulate Collection** refactoring technique.
- **Extract Method**: If this function is reused in multiple places, it might be beneficial to extract it into its own module or utility file for better organization and reusability.

By applying these refactoring techniques, the code can become more maintainable, readable, and adaptable to future changes.
