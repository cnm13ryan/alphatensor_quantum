## ClassDef GameStats
**Function Overview**:  
`GameStats` is a class that encapsulates statistics related to played games, including the number of games, best return, and average return for each considered target.

**Parameters**:
- **num_games**: The number of played games for each considered target. It includes a batch dimension.
  - **referencer_content**: True (Referenced by `RunState` and used in `_update_game_stats`)
  - **reference_letter**: True (Used in `init_run_state` and `_update_game_stats`)
- **best_return**: The best return (sum of rewards) for each considered target.
  - **referencer_content**: True (Referenced by `RunState` and used in `_update_game_stats`)
  - **reference_letter**: True (Used in `_update_game_stats`)
- **avg_return**: The average return (sum of rewards) for each considered target, smoothed over time.
  - **referencer_content**: True (Referenced by `RunState` and used in `_update_game_stats`)
  - **reference_letter**: True (Used in `_update_game_stats`)

**Return Values**:
- None. `GameStats` is a class that holds data attributes.

**Detailed Explanation**:
The `GameStats` class serves as a container for game statistics, specifically the number of games played (`num_games`), the best return achieved (`best_return`), and the average return over time (`avg_return`). These statistics are crucial for tracking performance across multiple targets or scenarios within a batch.

- **num_games**: This attribute keeps track of how many games have been played for each target. It is incremented when a game ends, as indicated by `is_terminal` in the `_update_game_stats` method.
  
- **best_return**: This attribute records the highest sum of rewards received from any single game for each target. It is updated whenever a new best score is achieved.

- **avg_return**: This attribute calculates the average return over time using an exponential smoothing technique. The smoothing factor (`smoothing`) determines how much weight is given to past returns versus new ones, allowing the average to adapt gradually to changes in performance.

**Relationship Description**:
`GameStats` is referenced and utilized by both `RunState` and within methods `_update_game_stats` and `init_run_state`. In `RunState`, it serves as a data structure to store game statistics. The method `init_run_state` initializes the `num_games`, `best_return`, and `avg_return` attributes, setting them up for tracking performance across games. The method `_update_game_stats` updates these statistics based on the outcomes of each game, ensuring that the `GameStats` object always reflects the most current performance metrics.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Extract Method**: Consider extracting the logic for updating `num_games`, `best_return`, and `avg_return` into separate methods within `_update_game_stats`. This would improve readability by breaking down a complex method into smaller, more focused ones.
  
- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: For complex expressions in `_update_game_stats`, such as those involving `jnp.where` and `jnp.vmap`, introducing explaining variables could enhance clarity. These variables should be named to reflect their purpose within the computation.

- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: The use of `jnp.where` for conditional updates can be complex. Simplifying these expressions by using guard clauses or breaking them into smaller parts might improve readability and maintainability.

- **Encapsulate Collection**: Directly exposing internal collections like `num_games`, `best_return`, and `avg_return` could lead to unintended modifications. Encapsulation through getter/setter methods or properties can help protect the integrity of these data structures while still allowing controlled access and modification.

By applying these refactoring techniques, the codebase can become more modular, easier to understand, and maintainable, adhering closely to best practices in software engineering.

## ClassDef NeuralNetwork
Doc is waiting to be generated...
### FunctionDef __init__(self, num_actions, net_config, name)
**Function Overview**: The `__init__` function initializes a new instance of the NeuralNetwork module with specified parameters.

**Parameters**:
- **num_actions**: The number of possible actions that the neural network can predict or handle. This parameter is crucial for defining the output layer size of the neural network.
  - **referencer_content**: Not explicitly indicated in the provided code snippet, but likely referenced by other components within the project to configure the neural network's action space.
  - **reference_letter**: Not indicated; no explicit reference to callees from this component based on the given information.
- **net_config**: An instance of `config_lib.NetworkParams` that contains hyperparameters and configurations for the neural network. This parameter is essential for defining the architecture and behavior of the neural network.
  - **referencer_content**: Not explicitly indicated in the provided code snippet, but likely referenced by other components within the project to configure the neural network's parameters.
  - **reference_letter**: Not indicated; no explicit reference to callees from this component based on the given information.
- **name**: A string representing the name of the module. Default value is 'NeuralNetwork'. This parameter helps in identifying the specific instance of the NeuralNetwork module within a larger system or application.
  - **referencer_content**: Not explicitly indicated in the provided code snippet, but likely referenced by other components within the project to identify and manage instances of the neural network.
  - **reference_letter**: Not indicated; no explicit reference to callees from this component based on the given information.

**Return Values**: This function does not return any values. It initializes the instance variables `_num_actions` and `_torso`.

**Detailed Explanation**: The `__init__` function performs several key tasks:
1. Calls the superclass constructor with the provided name, setting up the module's identity.
2. Assigns the number of actions to an internal variable `_num_actions`, which is used elsewhere in the class to define the output layer size or related configurations.
3. Initializes a `TorsoNetwork` instance using the provided network configuration (`net_config`) and assigns it to the `_torso` attribute. This step sets up the core architecture of the neural network based on the specified parameters.

**Relationship Description**: Based on the provided information, there is no explicit indication of functional relationships with other components within the project. The `__init__` function appears to be a standalone initializer that configures an instance of the NeuralNetwork module but does not directly interact with other parts of the system as per the given code snippet.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**: 
- **Parameter Validation**: Consider adding validation checks for `num_actions` and `net_config` to ensure they are within expected ranges or formats. This can prevent runtime errors and improve robustness.
- **Default Parameter Handling**: The default name 'NeuralNetwork' is fine, but consider whether it should be more descriptive based on the context in which this module is used.
- **Encapsulation**: Ensure that `_num_actions` and `_torso` are not directly accessed outside of the class. Instead, provide getter methods if necessary to maintain encapsulation principles.
- **Logging**: Implement logging within the `__init__` function to track initialization details, especially useful for debugging and auditing purposes.

No specific refactoring techniques from Martin Fowler’s catalog are immediately applicable based on the provided code snippet, as it is a straightforward initializer. However, adding validation and encapsulation practices can enhance maintainability and robustness of the module.

### FunctionDef __call__(self, observations)
**Function Overview**: The `__call__` function applies the neural network to a batched observed environment state and returns the policy logits and the output of the value head.

**Parameters**:
- **observations**: The (batched) observed environment state. This parameter is an instance of `environment.Observation`.
  - **referencer_content**: Not specified in the provided references.
  - **reference_letter**: Not specified in the provided references.

**Return Values**:
- A 2-tuple containing:
  - The policy logits, represented as a `jt.Float[jt.Array, 'batch_size num_actions']` array.
  - The output of the value head, represented as a `jt.Float[jt.Array, 'batch_size']` array.

**Detailed Explanation**: 
The `__call__` function processes the input observations through several steps:
1. **Embeddings Generation**: It first generates embeddings by passing the observations to the `_torso` method.
2. **Batch Size Determination**: The batch size is determined from the shape of the generated embeddings.
3. **Reshaping**: The embeddings are reshaped into a 2D array with dimensions `(batch_size, -1)`, where `-1` infers the second dimension based on the total number of elements.
4. **Linear Transformation**: A linear transformation is applied to the reshaped embeddings using `hk.Linear`. This layer has a size equal to the sum of `_num_actions` and 1.
5. **Return Values**: The function returns two values:
   - Policy logits, which are all but the last element along the last dimension of the transformed outputs.
   - Value head output, which is the last element along the last dimension of the transformed outputs.

**Relationship Description**:
- Since neither `referencer_content` nor `reference_letter` is specified in the provided references, there is no functional relationship to describe with other components within the project. The function operates independently based on its input parameters and returns processed data without interacting directly with other parts of the system as per the given information.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Extract Method**: Consider extracting the linear transformation into a separate method if it is reused elsewhere or if it becomes complex.
- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: Introducing explaining variables for `outputs[..., :-1]` and `outputs[..., -1]` can improve readability, especially if these expressions are used multiple times in other parts of the codebase.
- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: Although there are no conditionals in this function, if any were to be added (e.g., based on the batch size or number of actions), consider using guard clauses for improved readability and maintainability.
- **Encapsulate Collection**: If the embeddings or outputs are manipulated extensively elsewhere in the codebase, encapsulating them into a class could provide better control over their usage and modifications.

These suggestions aim to enhance the modularity, readability, and maintainability of the `__call__` function while adhering strictly to the provided code and references.

  - The output of the recurrent function, encapsulated in `mctx.RecurrentState` which includes policy logits and values.
  - The new environment states after applying actions.

**Detailed Explanation**:
The `_recurrent_fn` function performs several key operations:
1. **Environment State Update**: It updates the environment states by applying the provided actions using the `self._env.step(actions)` method, capturing both the new states and any rewards or terminations.
2. **Observation Processing**: The observations from the updated environment are processed to form a new batch of observations.
3. **Network Inference**: Using the network parameters (`params`), it computes policy logits and values for the new batch of observations through `self._network.apply(params, obs)`.
4. **Return Values**: It returns an instance of `mctx.RecurrentState` containing the computed policy logits and values, along with the updated environment states.

**Relationship Description**:
- `_recurrent_fn` is called by `_run_iteration_agent_env_interaction`, which manages the overall agent-environment interaction loop. This relationship indicates that `_recurrent_fn` plays a crucial role in updating the environment state and computing necessary outputs for further decision-making processes within the agent's strategy.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Extract Method**: The function could benefit from breaking down into smaller, more focused methods, such as one for updating the environment states and another for processing observations and network inference. This would improve readability and maintainability.
- **Introduce Explaining Variable**: For complex expressions or computations within the function, consider introducing explaining variables to clarify their purpose and enhance code clarity.
- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: If there are any conditional statements based on the environment states or other parameters, using guard clauses could simplify these conditions for better readability.

By applying these refactoring techniques, `_recurrent_fn` can be made more modular and easier to understand, facilitating future maintenance and development.
